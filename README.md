# 2ch-Browser-iOS

Source code of the 2ch Browser iOS application for iOS 8.2+.

You need VLC framework to build this project. You can find one here (look for the latest build): https://nightlies.videolan.org/build/iOS/
Download / unpack and drop *MobileVLCKit.framework* file to /dvach-browser/Frameworks/ directory.
*MobileVLCKit.framework* already linked in project - so you do not need to change anything there.
