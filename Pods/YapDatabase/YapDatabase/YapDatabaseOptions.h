/**
 * How should YapDatabase proceed if it is unable to open an existing database file
 * because sqlite finds it to be corrupt?
 *
 * - YapDatabaseCorruptAction_Fail
 *     The YapDatabase alloc/init operation will fail, and the init method will ultimately return nil.
 * 
 * - YapDatabaseCorruptAction_Rename
 *     The YapDatabase init operation will succeed, a new database file will be created,
 *     and the corrupt file will be renamed by adding the suffix ".X.corrupt", where X is a number.
 *
 * - YapDatabaseCorruptAction_Delete
 *     The YapDatabase init operation will succeed, a new database file will be created,
 *     and the corrupt file will be deleted.
 *
 * The default value is YapDatabaseCorruptAction_Rename.

 * For more information, see the sqlite docs:

 * 
 * The default page_size is traditionally 4096 on Apple systems.
 * 
 * Important: "It is not possible to change the database page size after entering WAL mode".
 * https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html
 *
 * And YapDatabase uses sqlite in WAL mode.
 * This means that if you intend to use a non-default page_size, you MUST configure the pragmaPageSize
 * before you first create the sqlite database file.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * - sqlite database file does not exist
 * - configure pragmaPageSize
 * - initialize YapDatabase with corresponding YapDatabaseOptions
 * - page_size will be set according to configuration
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * - sqlite database file already exists
 * - configure pragmaPageSize
 * - initialize YapDatabase with corresponding YapDatabaseOptions
 * - page_size cannot be changed - it remains as it was before
 * 
 * The default value is zero, meaning the default page size will be used.
 * E.g. YapDatabase will not attempt to set an explicit page_size.
 * 
 * You can verify whether or not sqlite accepted your page_size configuration request via:

 * 
 * This option allows you to enable Memory Mapped I/O.
 * https://www.sqlite.org/mmap.html
 * 
 * The default value is zero, meaning that Memory Mapped I/O is not used.
 * It is likely that you can achieve improved performance by setting this to a large value.
 * 
 * Note that memory mapping may not be available.
 * The feature was added to sqlite in version 3.7.17.
 * If using the built-in version of sqlite (with the OS), then this requires a minimum of:
 * - iOS 8.2
 * - Max OS X 10.10
 * 
 * For more information on SQLite versions that come pre-installed with the OS:
 * https://github.com/yapstudios/YapDatabase/wiki/SQLite-version-(bundled-with-OS)
 * 
 * Additionally, it appears that memory mapping is explicitly disabled in sqlite for iOS.
 * This can be seen by inspecting the sqlite.c source code file:
 * 
 * > #ifdef __APPLE__
 * > # include <TargetConditionals.h>
 * > # if TARGET_OS_IPHONE
 * > #   undef SQLITE_MAX_MMAP_SIZE
 * > #   define SQLITE_MAX_MMAP_SIZE 0
 * > # endif
 * > #endif
 *
 * It does, however, currently work for Mac OS X.

/**
 * There are a few edge-case scenarios where the sqlite WAL (write-ahead log) file
 * could grow without bound, because the normal checkpoint mechanisms are getting spoiled.
 * 
 * 1. The application only does a single large write at app launch.
 *    And afterwards, it only uses the database for reads.
 *    This may be due to a bug in sqlite. Generally, once the WAL has been fully checkpointed,
 *    the next write transaction will automatically reset the WAL. But we've noticed
 *    that if the next write occurs after restarting the process, then the WAL doesn't get reset.
 * 
 * 2. The application continually writes to the database without pause.
 *    The checkpoint operation can run in parallel with reads & writes.
 *    Normally this is optimal, as the last write (in a sequence) will conclude, followed by a checkpoint.
 *    And then the next write will reset the WAL.
 *    But if the application never ceases executing write operations,
 *    then we have no choice but to occasionally interrupt the writes in order to
 *    allow the checkpoint operation to catch up.
 * 
 * If the WAL file ever reaches the configured aggressiveWALTruncationSize,
 * then YapDatabase will effectively insert a checkpoint operation as a readWriteTransction.
 *
 * (This is in contrast to its normal optimized checkpoint operations, which can run in parallel with db writes.)
 * 
 * Note: The internals approximate the file size based on the number of reported frames in the WAL.
 * The approximation is generally a bit smaller than the actual file size (as reported by the file system).
 *
 * It's unlikely you'd even notice this "aggressive" checkpoint operation,
 * unless you were benchmarking or stress testing your database system.
 * In which case you may notice this aggressive checkpoint as something of a "stutter" in the system.
 *
 * The default value is (1024 * 1024) (i.e. 1 MB)
 * 
 * Remember: This value is specified as a number of bytes. For example:
 * -   1 KB == 1024 * 1
 * - 512 KB == 1024 * 512
 * -   1 MB == 1024 * 1024
 * -  10 MB == 1024 * 1024 * 10
