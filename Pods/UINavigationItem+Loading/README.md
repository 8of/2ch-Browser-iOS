==================================
![License](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg?style=flat)

Easy way to show loading/uploading status for user in a navigation bar.

## Introduction
With needing of this pattern again I decide to make this category. So here it is, with just few methods and fully customized in color.

## Demo
![NavigationBarLoaderDemo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Just-/demo/master/bar_loader_demo.gif)

or build it yourself 

`pod try UINavigationItem+Loading`

## Usage

Just import this category in your view controller (which is embed in UINavigationController).

`#import <UINavigationItem+Loading.h>`

When you need to show loading status just call

`[self.navigationItem startAnimatingAt:ANNavBarLoaderPositionCenter];`

Left, right and center position are available. So you can also use `ANNavBarLoaderPositionLeft` or `ANNavBarLoaderPositionRight` for loader position.
When you need to stop it nothing can be more simple as

`[self.navigationItem stopAnimating];`

Thatâ€™s all! 

To customize color for loader just set it with appearance proxy like this

`[UIActivityIndicatorView appearanceWhenContainedIn:[UINavigationBar class], nil].color = [UIColor blackColor];`

## Installation

Add the following to your [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) Podfile

`pod 'UINavigationItem+Loading', '~> 1.1'`

or clone it as a git submodule,

or just copy files
